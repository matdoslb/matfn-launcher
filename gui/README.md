Welcome to the **Reboot Launcher**! 
This is a GUI application developed as part of the **Reboot Project**.

## Getting Started

```
flutter run
```

### Building the Project
To create a production-ready build, use:
```
flutter build
```

### Packaging the Project

```
package.bat
```

## Requirements
- [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- Supported operating systems: Windows

## Other platforms

Native support for these platforms is not currently planned, but Linux support is a priority for the 10.0 release cycle

- [Linux Tutorial using Proton](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1fwa4l8/guide_running_a_fortnite_private_server_to_play/)
- No tutorials are available for MacOS(got lost when the Reboot discord was banned), but it's possible to run Reboot using a compatibility layer
