## matfn-launcher
A lightweight Client-only GUI Launcher based on [Reboot Launcher](https://github.com/Auties00/Reboot-Launcher). Will be used for matFN. All credits to Auties00

Install the launcher easily from the [releases](https://github.com/matdoslb/matfn-Launcher/releases/) section

beware! this has been modded to be used with the matFN ecosystem. the current cobalt.dll being used is a custom-made dll that redirects everythign to the matFN servers. If you do not wish to use the matFN servers, you will need to compile your own dll that redirects to your server of choice, or use aa pre-made dll (liek one from Nova, Era, Reboot etc..)

currently the launcher only uses chapter 1 season 7 (7.20), but in the launcher fiels, you can expand the lsit to include any version as long as you have the download link :)
