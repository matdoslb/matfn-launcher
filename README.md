A lightweight Client-only GUI Launcher based on [Project Reboot](https://github.com/Milxnor/Project-Reboot-3.0/). Will be used for matFN. All credits to Auties00

Install the launcher easily from the [releases](https://github.com/matdoslb/matfn-Launcher/releases/) section

## Modules

- COMMON: business logic for GUI module
  
- GUI: Stable graphical user interface to play and host Fortnite S0-14

beware! this has been modded to be used with the matFN ecosystem. the current cobalt.dll being used is a custom-made dll that redirects everythign to the matFN servers. If you do not wish to use the matFN servers, you will need to compile your own dll that redirects to your server of choice, or use aa pre-made dll (liek one from Nova, Era, Reboot etc..)
